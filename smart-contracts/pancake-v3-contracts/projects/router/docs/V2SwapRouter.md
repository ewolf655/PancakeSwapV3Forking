## V2SwapRouter

Router for stateless execution of swaps against PancakeSwap V2

### swapExactTokensForTokens

```solidity
function swapExactTokensForTokens(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, address[] path, address to) external payable returns (uint256 amountOut)
```

Swaps `amountIn` of one token for as much as possible of another token

_Setting `amountIn` to 0 will cause the contract to look up its own balance,
and swap the entire amount, enabling contracts to send tokens before calling this function._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountIn | uint256 | The amount of token to swap |
| amountOutMin | uint256 | The minimum amount of output that must be received |
| path | address[] | The ordered list of tokens to swap through |
| to | address | The recipient address |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountOut | uint256 | The amount of the received token |

### swapTokensForExactTokens

```solidity
function swapTokensForExactTokens(uint256 amountOut, uint256 amountInMax, address[] path, address to) external payable returns (uint256 amountIn)
```

Swaps as little as possible of one token for an exact amount of another token

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountOut | uint256 | The amount of token to swap for |
| amountInMax | uint256 | The maximum amount of input that the caller will pay |
| path | address[] | The ordered list of tokens to swap through |
| to | address | The recipient address |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountIn | uint256 | The amount of token to pay |
