### tickSpacing

```solidity
int24 tickSpacing

The pool tick spacing

_Ticks can only be used at multiples of this value, minimum of 1 and always positive
e.g.: a tickSpacing of 3 means ticks can be initialized every 3rd tick, i.e., ..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...

### observations

```solidity
struct Oracle.Observation[65535] observations

### lock

```solidity
modifier lock()
```

_Mutually exclusive reentrancy protection into the pool to/from a method. This method also prevents entrance

we use balance checks to determine the payment status of interactions such as mint, swap and flash._

### onlyFactoryOwner

```

Returns a snapshot of the tick cumulative, seconds per liquidity and seconds inside a tick range

_Snapshots must only be compared to other snapshots, taken over a period for which a position existed.
I.e., snapshots cannot be compared if a position is not held for the entire period between when the first
snapshot is taken and the second snapshot is taken._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tickLower | int24 | The lower tick of the range |

### observe

```solidity
function observe(uint32[] secondsAgos) external view returns (int56[] tickCumulatives, uint160[] secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s)
```

Returns the cumulative tick and liquidity as of each timestamp `secondsAgo` from the current block timestamp

_To get a time weighted average tick or liquidity-in-range, you must call this with two values, one representing
the beginning of the period and another for the end of the period. E.g., to get the last hour time-weighted average tick,
you must call it with secondsAgos = [3600, 0].
The time weighted average tick represents the geometric time weighted average price of the pool, in
log base sqrt(1.0001) of token1 / token0. The TickMath library can be used to go from a tick value to a ratio._

#### Parameters

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |

| secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s | uint160[] | Cumulative seconds per liquidity-in-range value as of each `secondsAgos` from the current block timestamp |
